    "    Define the following key variables for the extraction process: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **GEOGRAPHIC**: The **GEOGRAPHIC** refers to the **geographical scope** or **area of study** under study.  \n",
    "    - If the abstract mentions a specific region, **country**, or **city** such as **deprived neighbourhoods**, specific **countries**, or **cities**, specify this. \n",
    "    - If no geographical scope is mentioned, label it as \"None\". \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. **ITEM**: The specific practice, choice, lifestyle, public policy, private action, property, feature, technological device, system, or service mentioned in the abstract.  \n",
    "    **ITEM** cannot be a metric, measure, methods, or model. It refers to concrete actions, policies, features, or devices described in the text. \n",
    "    It should include the sense of variation of the **ITEM** (**increasing**, **lower**, **diminish**, etc.).  \n",
    "    The **ITEM** should be complete and as detailed as possible, extracting all relevant aspects from the abstract (for instance, if the abstract analyses the \"European regulation\" **ITEM** must report on what it applies (example: transport safety), if etc.). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Examples of ITEM**: \n",
    "    - **Practices, choices, behaviors, and lifestyles**: biking, carpooling, car-free lifestyle, teleworking. \n",
    "    - **Public policies or private actions**: carbon tax, transit infrastructure investment, reduced traffic zoning, corporate mobility plan, car weight reduction. \n",
    "    - **Properties and features of the built environment and cities**: sidewalks width, bike lanes investment, urban density, walkability, infrastructure. \n",
    "    - **Spatial distribution of urban amenities and location mismatches**: spatial mismatch, job accessibility, home-work separation, urban growth, sprawling development, residential specialization. \n",
    "    - **Technical or technological devices, systems, and services**: electric scooter sharing, bus rapid transit, microcars, trolleybus, tram systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **FACTOR**: The **FACTOR** refers to the specific outcome or characteristic that the **ITEM** impacts or influences. This could be a variable, metric, or property, such as CO2 emissions, energy use, health outcomes, traffic congestion, car dependency, food or job accessibility, income inequalities, or land use.  \n",
    "    - **FACTOR** cannot include negative formulations like \"decrease\", \"reduction\", \"lowering\", \"savings\", or \"loss of\". If the **FACTOR** is presented negatively in the abstract, it should be rephrased positively (e.g., \"CO2 emission reduction\" should be framed as \"CO2 emissions\", the reduction part would be included in the **CORRELATION**). \n",
    "    - **FACTOR** can also be an **ITEM** in the context of other **ITEMs**. In other words, an **ITEM** can act as a **FACTOR** for another **ITEM** if it influences or affects it. For example, **public transport** (an **ITEM**) can affect **CO2 emissions** (a **FACTOR**), but **CO2 emissions** can also be impacted by another **ITEM** like **carpooling**. Therefore, when extracting **ITEMs** and **FACTORS**, be aware that **ITEMs** can also act as **FACTORS** for other **ITEMs**. \n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **CORRELATION**: The **CORRELATION** describes the nature of the relationship between the **ITEM** and the **FACTOR**: \n",
    "    - If the **ITEM** is **increasing** or **raising** the **FACTOR**, label it as \"increasing\". \n",
    "    - If the **ITEM** is **reducing**, **diminishing**, or **lowering** the **FACTOR**, label it as \"decreasing\". \n",
    "    - If the **ITEM** has a **neutral impact** on the **FACTOR**, label it as \"neutral\". \n",
    "    - If the **ITEM** has an **unspecified** effect, label it as \"None\". \n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **POPULATION**: The **POPULATION** refers to the specific **socio-demographic group** affected by the **FACTOR**.   \n",
    "    - If the abstract mentions a specific socio-demographic group, such as people in **elderly**, **young**, **low-income households**, **first decile**, **suburban households**, **peripheral**, etc., specify this. \n",
    "    - If no socio-demographic group is mentioned, label it as \"None\". \n",
    "\n",
    "    6. **MODE**: The **MODE** refers to the specific modes of transportation related to the **ITEM** and mentioned in the abstract.   \n",
    "    - If the abstract mentions transportation modes, such as **bus**, **car**, **bike**, **bike-sharing**, **public transport**, **electric scooter**, **automobile**, etc., please specify it. \n",
    "    - If no **mode of transport** is **clearly** mentioned, leave it as \"None\". \n",
    "\n",
    "    7. **ACTOR**: The **ACTOR** refers to the institution or person directly effecting the **ITEM** and mentioned in the abstract.  \n",
    "    - If the abstract mentions, such as **government**, **local authority**, **car manufacturer**, **firm**, **individual** etc., please specify it.  \n",

    "    2. Extract all the **ITEMs** mentioned. If **no ITEMs** are found in the abstract, return **None** and stop the prompt. \n",
    "    3. For each extracted **ITEM**, determine whether it has a **increasing**, **decreasing**, or **neutral** effect on one or more **FACTORS**. Extract the impacted **FACTORS** (write \"None\" if no factors are impacted). \n",
